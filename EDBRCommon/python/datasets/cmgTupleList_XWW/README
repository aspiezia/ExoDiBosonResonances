This is a log of the changes in the cmgTuple.

cmgTuple0219/ : trees used for with CA8 used for Shuai's talk on Wednesday 20th Feb. 2013

cmgTuple0225/ : update with btagging information. Algorithm is CSV. Six more userfloat are added to each candidate, in ExoDiBosonResonances/EDBRCommon/plugins/KineVarsAdder.h
			    change loose mu id to be traker muon without isolation.

cmgTuple0304/ : update since 0225, change only CA8 - > AK7 in EDBRCommon/python/jet_cff.py

cmgTuple_07032013_CA8/ : new code edbr_vv_20130313 (many fixes: btag, pT cuts, etc..) - CA8 ----------btag wrong

cmgTuple_07032013_AK7/ : new code edbr_vv_20130313 (many fixes: btag, pT cuts, etc..) - AK7 --------- btag wrong

cmgTuple_08032013_CA8/ : update from cmgTuple_07032013_CA8, with corrected cleaning lepton from ak5 jets. Change also mu eta <2.1.

cmgTuple_08032013_AK7/ : update from cmgTuple_07032013_AK7, with corrected cleaning lepton from ak5 jets. Change also mu eta <2.1.

cmgTuple_0314_CA8/     : update from cmgTuple_07032013_CA8, 
						0) fixed the problem of 2 jet filter, 
						1) For the analysis, cut on pt WL>200, pt jet>200 (for 1jet case)
						2) For ttbar control region, made a new collection, with pt WL>160, pt jet>200, mass range (40,130). Btagging is not applied.
						3) corrected ntau12 to ntao21

cmgTuple_0409_CA8/     : update from cmgTuple_0314_CA8, 
						1) for the bestCandidate we are using now the highest pt jet
						2) fullrange ptWL changed to 200

cmgTuple_0429_CA8/     : update from cmgTuple_0314_CA8, 
						1) for the bestCandidate we are using now the highest pt jet
						2) fullrange ptWL changed to 200
                                                3) remove W mass cut 77.3, 83.3
                                                4) changed Pz assignment (using type-2 from FNAL group, i.e. 
                                                   choosing the smallest of the two real roots + neutrino PT correction for complex roots) 

cmgTuple_0428_CA8/     : update from cmgTuple_0314_CA8, 
						1) for the bestCandidate we are using now the highest pt jet
						2) fullrange ptWL changed to 200
                                                3) remove W mass cut 77.3, 83.3
                                                4) changed Pz assignment (using type-2 from FNAL group by default, i.e. 
                                                   choosing the smallest of the two real roots + NO neutrino PT correction for complex roots) 

cmgTuple_0601         : apply synchronization changes.

cmgTuple_0627         :  add btag weight


cmgTuple_1012         :   list for 539. data using 22-Jan2013 


cmgTuple_1030_signalcmg_nocut   : use "selection=none" to produce signals
